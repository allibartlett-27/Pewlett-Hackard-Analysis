# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## 1. OVERVIEW
Hewlett Packard is on the verge of experiencing a "silver tsunami", with a large number of current employees set to retire. The anaylsis we were asked to run helped determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## 2. RESULTS
Based of the data analysis run: 
- Pewlett Hackard could potentially see 90,398 employees retire. 
- The departments that would be most affected would be Senior Engineering, potentially losing 29,414 team members, and Senior Staff, potentially losing 28,254. 
- The orginial retiring titles started with 133,777 titles but then we filtered out the duplicate employees who we can assume have been promoted or transferred through their career with Pewlett Hackard. This data also included 14,187 employees who no longer work at Pewlett Hackard, so I believe there are 76,211 employees who may retire in the near future. 
- It would be beneficial to run some additional analysis to get additional indicators of when employees may retire. For example, running a query to show when past employees retired and what their tenure was, may give us some additional insight to when employees may retire.

## 3. SUMMARY
*How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?*

- Based on the unique retiring titles, there could 90,398 employees in the retirement 'window'. 

*Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?*

- According to the mentorship eligibilty anaylsis, there are only 1,941 employees, which is not enough. However, this anaylsis was only run based on employees born within a one-year span, so I would recommend expanding this to incorporate a larger number of employees who are interested and eligiblity for those roles with the larger number of employees leaving.
